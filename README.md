# DeepLearning-TensorFlow

performing Deep Learning with TensorFlow

Recently Tensorflow has been a very hot cake library release by Google for deep learning work in AI.	

It is an open source library design for the deep learning task and

Very efficient for computation of data flow graphs. 

 It is designed to work on both single or multiple CPUs and GPUs.
 
It can also run on mobile operating systems.  

With this knowledge you can then:

    1.	Create convolutional Neural Networks

    2.	Build Natural Language Models 

    3.	Develop recurrent Neural Networks

We are going to create a simple 3-layered neural network to help classify MNIST dataset.
